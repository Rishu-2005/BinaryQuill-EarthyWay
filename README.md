Project Description:-
The growing need for sustainable transportation has led to the development of eco-friendly transport-sharing platforms. These platforms aim to reduce carbon emissions, promote efficient transport solutions, and decrease traffic congestion by leveraging modern technologies. This project will outline how such a platform can be built using Java, focusing on integrating electric vehicles (EVs) and bicycles and emphasising Java-based architecture and programming.
